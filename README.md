- This project was proposed by Rocketseat during one of their free courses.
- The UI was completely redesigned for this exercise.
- As most projects, this one is not bug/error-free. If you find something wrong and want to share it with me, feel free to do so around here or via email - dfaferreira46@gmail.com
